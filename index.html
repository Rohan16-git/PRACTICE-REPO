        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
        browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        its appearance.

                        Content: HTML is used to add various types of content to a webpage, including text, images,
                        videos,
                        and audio.
                        Links: HTML is used to create links between different pages and websites, allowing users to
                        navigate
                        the web.
                        Forms: HTML is used to create forms that allow users to input data, such as contact information
                        or
                        search queries.</td>

                        and layout.
                        Layout: CSS allows for complex layouts, with the ability to position elements on a page and
                        adjust
                        their size and spacing.
                        Responsiveness: CSS allows for responsive design, where the layout and style of a webpage can
                        adapt
                        to different screen sizes and device types.
                        Animations: CSS can be used to create animations and transitions on a webpage, making it more
                        interactive and engaging</td>

            <h1 class="color">Similarities between HTML and CSS</h1>
<p class="colorp">
    Syntax: Both HTML and CSS use a similar syntax, with the use of tags and selectors to define elements on a webpage.
Separation of Concerns: Both HTML and CSS follow the principle of separation of concerns, where HTML defines the structure and content of a webpage, while CSS defines the style and layout.
Cascading: The “C” in CSS stands for “Cascading”, which means that styles can be inherited and overridden based on the order of the style rules and the specificity of the selectors.
Integration: HTML and CSS are often used together, with CSS being used to style the elements defined in HTML.
